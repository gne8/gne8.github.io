<h4>GM</h4>

Welcome to the digital den of thecool, a former data scientist turned web3 explorer. Previously engrossed in hunting alphas and seeking +ev trades, I've now shifted focus to be a contributor and builder.

My background in analytics makes onchain analysis a natural fit for me. Plus, my past adventures in the crypto wilderness have made me quite familiar with onchain data. But the allure of the various development technologies in the web3 space is too strong to resist. So, I've decided to become a jack of all trades, exploring all the exciting possibilities before deciding where to focus my efforts.

Through this blog, I'll share my experiences, discoveries, and learnings in an easy-to-understand manner. I hope that my journey can inspire you, teach you something new, and perhaps even entertain you a little.

So buckle up, and let's dive into the world of web3 together!
